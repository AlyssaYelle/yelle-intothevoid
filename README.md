# YELLE INTO THE VOID
Capstone project for the American Express Developer Academy. I wanted to build something very personal that I'd be motivated to maintain, so this is a website for my art.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
#### Front End
React

#### Back End
Java, Spring Boot, Flask

#### Database
Postgres SQL

#### Microservices
Docker, AWS

## SCHEMA
I have two microservices -- content and newsletter. The content service consists of an administrative table containing a single superuser (myself), who can add and edit content. The newsletter service consists of a table containing a list of email addresses. Any visitor can add their email address.
